    - qcom,msm-bus,num_cases - There are three valid cases for this: NONE, MAX
		and MIN bandwidth votes. Minimum two cases must be defined for
		both NONE and MAX votes. If MIN vote is different from NONE VOTE
		then specify third case for MIN VOTE.
    - qcom,msm-bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm-bus,vectors
- qcom,hsusb-otg-lpm-on-dev-suspend: If present then USB enter to

	wait for the handshake with the IPA to complete before entering low
	power mode.
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node.
         Optional "supply-name" is "vbus_otg" to supply vbus in host mode.

	values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage
	in microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner.

	and controller driver therefore enables pull-up explicitly before
	starting controller using usbcmd run/stop bit.
- qcom,usb2-enable-hsphy2: If present then USB2 controller is connected to 2nd
	HSPHY.
- qcom,hsusb-log2-itc: value of 2^(log2_itc-1) will be used as the
	interrupt threshold (ITC), when log2_itc is between 1 to 7.

	configured for detection of dm line transition during VDD minimization.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-vddmin-gpio = If present, indicates a gpio that will be used
	to supply voltage to the D+ line during VDD minimization and peripheral
	bus suspend. If not exists, then VDD minimization will not be allowed
	during peripheral bus suspend.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-rw-during-lpm-workaround: If present, indicates that remote-
	wakeup during USB low-power mode SW workaround will be applied. When
	this workaround is applied, the PHCD and the FPR bits are written
	to the PORTSC register in the same register write operation.
- qcom,ahb-async-bridge-bypass: If present, indicates that enable AHB2AHB By Pass
	mode with device controller for better throughput. With this mode, USB Core
	runs using PNOC clock and synchronous to it. Hence it is must to have proper
	"qcom,msm-bus,vectors" to have high bus frequency. User shouldn't try to
	enable this feature without proper bus voting.
- qcom,disable-retention-with-vdd-min: If present don't allow phy retention but allow
	vdd min.

  (perf, normal, sleep) where each value respresents DMA latency in microsecs.
  First value represents DMA latency to vote with pm_qos when back to back USB
  transfers are happening and it requires USB thoughput to be maximum.
  Second value represents value to vote when not many USB transfers are
  happening and it is OK to have higher DMA latency to save power.

  is being enable as part of USB composition, streaming mode is enable with
  usb device controller to get better throughput. NOTE: Inverted CRC and
  turnaround timeout is observed on enabling streaming. Hence it is required
  to see these errors and number of erros on enabling this at USB level to make
  final decision to enable this feature or not.
Example Android USB device node :
	android_usb@fc42b0c8 {
		compatible = "qcom,android-usb";
		reg = <0xfc42b0c8 0xc8>;
                qcom,pm-qos-latency = <2 1001 12701>;
